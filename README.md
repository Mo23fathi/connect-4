#Connect-4 Game with AI Algorithms
This Java project implements a Connect-4 game with AI algorithms for player vs. computer gameplay. Connect-4 is a classic two-player game where the objective is to connect four of one's own discs in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent does.

Overview
The project consists of the following Java files:

Minimax Algorithm (connect-4-with-AI_min_max): Implements the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the computer player to make intelligent moves.
Board Class (connect-4-with-AI_board): Represents the game board and provides methods for placing discs, checking for winning conditions, and displaying the board.
Main Class (connect-4-with-AI_main): Main class to run the Connect-4 game and interact with the player.

Features
Player vs. Computer: Play against the computer AI, which uses the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.
Interactive Gameplay: Enjoy a user-friendly interface with prompts for player moves and visual representation of the game board.
Customizable Difficulty: Adjust the difficulty level of the AI by changing parameters such as search depth in the Minimax algorithm.
